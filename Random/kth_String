# Initialize the string with a
# Now run till the length of the word is less than k
# Now run a loop for the word
# For each alphabet - take the next - chr(ord(letter)) + 1
# Merge the alphabets	
# Bring them all together in the word
# Repeat the loop till the word length is less than k
# Now get the kth alphabet from the word
# Time complexity - O(n^2)
# Space Complexity - O(n)
